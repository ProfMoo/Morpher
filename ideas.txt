ideas:
(1) be able to hold onto a wall by holding into it?
(2) be able to hold down and 'sit down' when on a platform?
(3) have a function that 'converts' a player to a different type. (put in some new images?)

debug: display hitbox of player with debug switch
	currently it's just the image, so i need some way to have it display HITBOX
